service will install / un-install, start / stop, and run a program as a service (daemon).
Currently supports Windows XP+, Linux/(systemd | Upstart | SysV), and OSX/Launchd.

To start out follow "example/main.go".

This package is still in BETA. Detecting if this is running as a daemon or from a
user is not tested on all platforms. It is tested on Windows and Linux Upstart
system service. Need to test the following platforms:
 * Upstart, user service
 * systemd system and user service
 * Launchd system and user service

Also the remainder of the configuration struct needs to be wired into the install
step for most platforms. Platform capabilities and KeyValues need documentation.
